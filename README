# Purpose
-- The purpose of this script and the pain I have endured creating it are to make bc redundant within POSIX sh
-- The one thing bc can do that POSIX sh arithmetic cannot is float math
# Usage
-- $ ./floatm 'NUM.1 + NUM.2'
-- psh-float only supports the basic operations; psh-float is a POC and I have no plans to make it a full-fledged library
# Shellcheck
-- Current shellcheck warnings are intended
# s()
-- The s() function used in ./floatm comes from shappet/bin/seq, and is a pure sh micro implementation of seq
