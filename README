# Purpose
-- The purpose of this script and the pain I have endured creating it are to make bc redundant within POSIX sh
-- The one thing bc can do that POSIX sh arithmetic cannot is float math
-- $ dash ./floatm 'NUM.1 + NUM.2'
-- psh-float only supports the basic operations; psh-float is a POC and I have no plans to make it a full-fledged library
# Shellcheck
-- Current shellcheck warnings are intended
# s()
-- The s() function used in ./floatm comes from shappet/bin/seq, and is a pure sh micro implementation of seq
---
# Caveats
-- arithmetic found inside use numbers extremely close to the maximum allowed within some shells
-- infact, the numbers offten go over the maximum, as such this script has only been built to work with dash
-- results from other shells are likely to be incorrect
----
-- sh was never meant to work with floats.
-- Please, for the sake of all that is good, DO NOT USE THIS
-- This is a proof of concept, and works ionly if your lucky
-- and your sh imp actually supports numbers this big
