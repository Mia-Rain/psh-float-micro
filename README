# Purpose
-- The purpose of this script and the pain I have endured creating it are to make bc redundant within POSIX sh
-- The one thing bc can do that POSIX sh arithmetic cannot is float math
---
# Current status
-- Currently we can convert from decimals to floats - SOMETIMES
-- However; currently there is no support for negatives
-- And decimals with a whole number not above 0 will break
-- Support is very very bad currently; I'm working on it
-- Currently the test number 7.6 works perfectly in both ways
-- Clearly there are some bugs I need to iron out ...
---
# Testing
-- I would prefer if users did not test at the current time
-- I know that everything is broken, and I plan to fix it
-- However; if you want to see it in action and not open a billion issues
-- Do the following
```
$ dash ./floatm '7.66'
# expected output is 0 10000001 11101010001111010111000
$ dash ./floatm '0 10000001 11101010001111010111000'
# expected output is ~7.66 - 7.65973625176 
---
# Caveats
-- arithmetic found inside use numbers extremely close to the maximum allowed within some shells
-- infact, the numbers offten go over the maximum, as such this script has only been built to work with dash
-- results from other shells are likely to be incorrect
----
-- sh was never meant to work with floats.
-- Please, for the sake of all that is good, DO NOT USE THIS
-- This is a proof of concept, and works ionly if your lucky
-- and your sh imp actually supports numbers this big
